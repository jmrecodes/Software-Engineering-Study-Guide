## Why Foundations Matter
Before engaging with advanced architecture, keep essentials sharp. DRY avoids scattered knowledge, KISS keeps solutions understandable, and YAGNI prevents speculative work. Mastering them drastically reduces rework.

## How to Navigate
1. Start with the principle causing the most friction in your current project.
2. Follow "Next" links to move sequentially or jump using the list below.
3. Use exercises where you copy snippets into `/05-code-examples` practice files.
4. Keep `../../06-quick-reference/cheatsheet.md` open for rapid reminders.

## Principle Summaries
- [`dry-principle.md`](dry-principle.md): Centralize logic, eliminate duplication, and measure knowledge reuse.
- [`kiss-principle.md`](kiss-principle.md): Deliver clear, minimal solutions without unnecessary abstraction.
- [`yagni-principle.md`](yagni-principle.md): Build only what delivers immediate value and defer speculative features.

## Starter Checklist
- [ ] Duplicate logic is cataloged and scheduled for consolidation.
- [ ] Recent features were implemented with the simplest approach possible.
- [ ] Backlog items are validated against actual user needs before implementation.

## Self-Assessment
- [ ] Can you identify the cost of duplication vs. abstraction in your project?
- [ ] Can you explain when simplicity should yield to scalability?
- [ ] Can you highlight features that were built but never used?
