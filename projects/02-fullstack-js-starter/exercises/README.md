# Exercises Playground

This folder provides scaffolding for hands-on challenges referenced in `docs/06-EXERCISES-AND-CHALLENGES.md`.

## Structure
- `backend/` – Start new API features or test alternate implementations.
- `frontend/` – Prototype UI experiments or alternative state management techniques.

## Recommended Workflow
1. Create a new Git branch for each exercise (`git checkout -b exercise/task-priority`).
2. Copy relevant files from `starter-kit/backend/src` or `starter-kit/frontend/src` into mirrored folders here as a sandbox.
3. Iterate freely—break things on purpose to learn how to fix them.
4. Compare your solution with the `solutions` branch when ready.

> **TRY THIS:** Challenge yourself to write a short reflection after completing each exercise. Document what surprised you and what you would do differently next time.
