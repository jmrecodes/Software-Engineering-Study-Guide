You’ve built the starter kit—now expand your skills and projects.

---

## Extending This Project
- Add calendar integrations for due dates (Google Calendar API).
- Introduce teams/collaboration with shared boards.
- Build analytics dashboards (task completion trends).
- Deploy to cloud platforms (Render + Vercel) and enable HTTPS.

## Learning Path Recommendations
1. **Deepen TypeScript:** Explore generics, utility types, and advanced typing patterns.
2. **API Testing:** Learn Jest, Supertest, or Vitest for automated test suites.
3. **State Management:** Experiment with Redux Toolkit, Zustand, or React Query.
4. **DevOps Basics:** Containerize with Docker, set up CI pipelines (GitHub Actions).
5. **Accessibility:** Study WCAG guidelines, use testing tools like axe-core.

## From Learning to Production
- Add centralized logging (Winston, Pino) and monitoring (Sentry).
- Enforce environment-specific configs (dev vs staging vs prod).
- Harden security (rate limiting, helmet, CSRF protection).
- Implement proper error tracking and alerting.

## Career Guidance
- **Junior Expectations:** Understand fundamentals, communicate clearly, write maintainable code, ask good questions.
- **Portfolio Building:** Turn challenges into case studies. Document your process and lessons learned.
- **Interview Prep:** Practice explaining the request-response cycle or how JWT auth works—those questions show up often.
