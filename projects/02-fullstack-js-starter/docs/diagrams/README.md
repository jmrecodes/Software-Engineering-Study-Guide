This folder holds visual aids referenced throughout the documentation. Use tools like [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) or [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) to import the `.drawio` or `.excalidraw` files if you create them.

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `architecture.drawio` | High-level system overview, from browser to database. |
| `auth-flow.excalidraw` | JWT authentication sequence diagram. |

**TRY THIS:** Recreate the diagrams yourself to ensure you understand each step. Visual learning cements complex flows.
